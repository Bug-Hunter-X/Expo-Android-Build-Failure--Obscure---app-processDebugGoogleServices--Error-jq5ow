The solution is multi-faceted.  First, meticulously review your `google-services.json` file. Ensure it's correctly placed in the `android/app` directory.  Any discrepancies will cause build issues. Second, check your `package.json` and ensure the dependencies (especially those related to Firebase or Google services) are correctly defined and match the versions used in other parts of the project. Conflicts can cause this error.  If this doesn't resolve it, clean your project's build cache:

1. **Clean the project:**  Run `expo prebuild --clean` to remove old build files and directories. 
2. **Invalidate caches/restart:** If the problem persists, try invalidating caches in your IDE (e.g., Android Studio) and restarting it.  Sometimes IDE processes retain corrupt information.
3. **Ensure Correct Firebase Setup:** Double check your Firebase project and make sure it's correctly configured and linked to your Expo project.  Verify that the SHA-1 fingerprint from your keystore matches what's in your Firebase project settings. 
4. **Check for Conflicting Plugins:** Check if any other native plugins are conflicting with Firebase. Try disabling other plugins one by one to identify potential conflicts.
5. **Update Expo CLI:** Make sure that your Expo CLI is up to date. Run `expo upgrade` to ensure you have the latest version.
After performing these steps, try rebuilding your project. If the problem continues, provide more details about your project setup, including your `package.json`, the complete error message, and other relevant configuration files.
