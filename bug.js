This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with the error message `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices`.  The error message does not provide a clear indication of the underlying issue. The issue might stem from incorrect configuration of the `google-services.json` file, mismatched dependencies, or corruption in the project's build files.  This can happen even if you have followed all the official Expo documentation correctly.
